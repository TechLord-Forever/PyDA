A Python DisAssembler that aims to provide disassembling of many architectures and file types from the Capstone Disassembly Engine.

This Disassembler uses the Capstone Engine found at http://www.capstone-engine.org/. In order to make this program work, you must visit http://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html and download the appropriate libraries to make it work. If you are on windows, just install the "Python module for Windows XX - Binaries" and you're good to go. For other operating systems, follow the steps at http://www.capstone-engine.org/documentation.html to install the engine and python bindings. It's fairly straightforward and easy to do.
