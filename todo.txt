Disassembly model: (can be commondisassemblyformat)
disass model has a set of labels
print a section
at each address, look in labels to see if this point is a label
if so, print an extra space before
then the label
then the actual instruction at that position




Label:
	address
	name
	window_location -> set when data is created
	(xrefs)

Function:
	needs a label -> pass one by reference
	double-click function -> look up label -> go to window_location in label

String:
	same as function



Design decision:
	Do we want to keep everything coupled to the common disassembly format or are we just manipulating text?
	Two options for implementing commenting:
		1) Attach it to the end of the current line in 'data'
		2) Make an actual field in CommonInstFormat
			a. Requires that we can go from the current selected text back to the CIF that generated it
